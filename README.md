# Diabetes_Retinopathy

This is a project created to detect the existence of diabetes through retinal images. It uses Gaussian-matched filter banks and K-means clustering as their data preprocessing algorithms. The dataset that we have used is Fundus images, which are present in Kaggle. We have used three models: SVM, KNN and Random forest tree decision.
